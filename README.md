# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project predicts whether a person is **non-diabetic (-1)**, **pre-diabetic (0)**, or **diabetic (1)** based on their fasting glucose and postprandial (PP) glucose levels. It also provides diet and exercise to help improve health.

## Features
- Predicts diabetes status using fasting and PP glucose levels.
- Provides health recommendations like exercise and diet plans.
- Uses **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** for predictions.
- Normalizes data with **StandardScaler** for better model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning** (Support Vector Classifier)
- **Flask** (for backend, if applicable)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for frontend, if applicable)

## How to Use
1. Input fasting and PP glucose levels.
2. Run the prediction model.
3. Get the diabetes status and health recommendations.

## About the Dataset
- Real-life data with fasting and PP glucose levels.
- Labels:
  - `-1`: Non-diabetic
  - `0`: Pre-diabetic
  - `1`: Diabetic

## Goal
To help individuals and healthcare providers predict diabetes risk and take proactive steps toward better health.
